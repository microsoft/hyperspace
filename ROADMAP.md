# Hyperspace Roadmap

This document defines a high level roadmap for Hyperspace development and upcoming releases. 
Community and contributor involvement is vital for successfully implementing all desired 
items for each release. We hope that the items listed below will inspire further engagement 
from the community to keep Hyperspace progressing and shipping exciting and valuable features.

**Note**: Any dates listed below and the specific issues that will ship in a given milestone 
are subject to change but should give a general idea of what we are planning. We use the 
milestone feature in Github so look there for the most up-to-date and issue plan.

If you see a problem on this, or something is not clear, please consider 
[opening an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/hyperspace/issues).

In short, there are **six** parallel tracks of work happening within Hyperspace. While we use the
word *track* to imply that work can happen mostly independently without depending on design
decisions from the other tracks, should the community notice such a hard dependency, we should
work towards making the tracks independent, to the extent possible.

The best way to understand the tracks shown in the figure is:
  - **Track 1**: This is the foundation where we ensure that the meta-data we are
    storing
