# Welcome!

If you are here, it means you are interested in helping us out. A hearty welcome and thank you! There are many ways you can contribute to the Hyperspace project:

* Offer PR's to fix bugs or implement new features.
* Give us feedback and bug reports regarding the software or the documentation.
* Improve our examples, tutorials, and documentation.

Please start by browsing the [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/hyperspace/issues) and leave a comment to engage us if any of them interests you.

Please make sure to take a look at the project [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## Contributing Code

* Before starting working on a major feature or bug fix, please open a GitHub issue describing the work you are proposing. We will make sure no one else is already working on it and the work aligns with the project [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).
* A "major" feature or bug fix is defined as any change that is > 100 lines of code (not including tests) or changes user-facing behavior (e.g., breaking API changes).
* Once you are ready, you can create a [PR](https://github.com/microsoft/hyperspace/pulls) and the committers will help reviewing your PR.
