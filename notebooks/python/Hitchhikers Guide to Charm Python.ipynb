        "  1. Queries contain filters on predicates with high selectivity (e.g., you want to select 100 matching rows from a million candidate rows)\n",
        "  2. Queries contain a join that requires heavy-shuffles (e.g., you want to join a 100 GB dataset with a 10 GB dataset)\n",

        "To begin with, let's start a new Spark session. Since this notebook is a tutorial merely to illustrate what Charm can offer, we will make a configuration change that allow us to highlight what Charm is doing on small datasets. By default, Spark uses *broadcast join* to optimize join queries when the data size for one side of join is small (which is the case for the sample data we use in this tutorial). Therefore, we disable broadcast joins so that later when we run join queries, Spark uses *sort-merge* join. This is mainly to show how Charm indexes would be used at scale for accelerating join queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of running the cell below shows a reference to the successfully created Spark session and prints out '-1' as the value for the modified join config which indicates that broadcast join is successfully disabled."
