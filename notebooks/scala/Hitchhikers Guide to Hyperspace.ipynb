Since this notebook is a tutorial merely to illustrate what Hyperspace can offer, we will make a configuration change that allow us to highlight what Hyperspace is doing on small datasets. By default, Spark™ uses *broadcast join* to optimize join queries when the data size for one side of join is small (which is the case for the sample data we use in this tutorial). Therefore, we disable broadcast joins so that later when we run join queries, Spark™ uses *sort-merge* join. This is mainly to show how Hyperspace indexes would be used at scale for accelerating join queries.\n",
