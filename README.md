### Development on Windows

This repository contains symbolic links which don't work properly on Windows. To build this project on Windows, you can use our provided Git aliases to replace symbolic links with junctions.

```sh
$ git config --local include.path ../dev/.gitconfig
$ git replace-symlinks # replace symlinks with junctions
$ #git restore-symlinks # use this to restore symlinks if you need
```

### Using IntelliJ

You can use the built-in sbt shell in IntelliJ without any problems. However, the built-in "Build Project" command may not work. To fix the issue, go to Project Structure -> Project Settings -> Modules and follow these steps:

- Mark `src/main/scala` and `src/main/scala-spark2` as "Sources" and `src/test/scala` and `src/test/scala-spark2` as "Tests" for the `spark2_4` module.
- Mark `src/main/scala` and `src/main/scala-spark3` as "Sources" and `src/test/scala` and `src/test/scala-spark3` as "Tests" for the `spark3_0` module.
- Remove the `root` and `hyperspace-sources` modules.
- An example of [Project Structure](./docs/assets/images/project_structure.png)

Additionally, you might have to run `sbt buildInfo` if you encounter an error like `object BuildInfo is not a member of package com.microsoft.hyperspace` for the first build.

To debug with the sbt shell in IntelliJ, run `set Test/fork := false` in the sbt shell so that the debugger attached to the sbt shell can work. Without this, breakpoints won't work.

For a better IntelliJ and other IDE-like environment (e.g., coc.nvim) experience, try replacing symbolic links with hard links if you are in macOS or Linux.

```sh
$ rm spark3.1/src
$ mkdir spark3.1/src
$ git update-index --assume-unchanged spark3.1/src
$ sudo mount localhost:<absolute path to hyperspace repo>/src spark3.1/src # macOS (NFS required)
$ mount --bind src spark3.1/src # Linux
```

With this setup, just be cautious when you do Git operations in the repository. For example, `git checkout --` will wipe out every file in `src` because Git doesn't know that essentially you've made hard links. If you want to reset source files, do `git checkout -- src` instead.

## Inspiration and Special Thanks

This project would not have been possible without the outstanding work from the following communities:

- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/): Unified Analytics Engine for Big Data, the engine that
  Hyperspace builds on top of.
- [Delta Lake](https://delta.io): Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID
  transactions to Apache Spark™ and big data workloads. Hyperspace derives quite a bit of inspiration
  from the way the Delta Lake community operates and pioneering of some surrounding ideas in the
  context of data lakes (e.g., their novel use of optimistic concurrency).
- [Databricks](https://databricks.com/): Unified analytics platform. Many thanks to all the inspiration
  they have provided us.
- [.NET for Apache Spark™](https://github.com/dotnet/spark): Hyperspace offers .NET bindings for
  developers, thanks to the efforts of this team in collaborating and releasing the bindings just-in-time.
- [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes): The awesome theme behind
  Hyperspace documentation.
