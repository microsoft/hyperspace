/**
 * Action to refresh indexes with newly appended files and deleted files in an incremental way.
 *
 * For appended files, newly arrived data in the original source dataset (more specifically under
 * rootPaths), will be handled as follows:
 * - Identify newly added data files.
 * - Create new index version on these files.
 * - Update metadata to reflect the latest snapshot of index. This snapshot includes all the old
 *   and the newly created index files. The source content points to the latest data files.
 *
 * For deleted files, some original source data file(s) are removed between previous version of
 * index and now, will be handled as follows:
 * - Identify deleted source data files.
 * - Index records' lineage is leveraged to remove any index entry coming
 *    from those deleted source data files.
 *
 * @param spark SparkSession.
 * @param logManager Index LogManager for index being refreshed.
 * @param dataManager Index DataManager for index being refreshed.
