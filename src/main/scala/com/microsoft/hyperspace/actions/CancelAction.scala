/**
 * Cancelling an action. This action is used if index maintenance operations fail and leave the

 * [[REFRESHING]] state, preventing future index operations. Cancelling brings the index
 * back to the last known stable state.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  - Find the last stable active state log entry
 *  - save the next log entry with the contents of the last active state log entry
 *  - TODO: (optionally cleanup any partial files created during previous jobs)
