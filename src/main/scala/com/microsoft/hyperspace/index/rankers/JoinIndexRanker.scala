/**

object JoinIndexRanker {

  /**
   * Rearranges all available index options according to their cost. The first one is the best
   * with minimum cost.
   *
   * If hybridScanEnabled is false, pick the one with least amount of shuffling and most number
   * of buckets. When two indices have same number of buckets, there is zero shuffling.
   * If number of buckets differ, one of the indices gets reshuffled into the number of buckets
   * equal to the other.
   * Secondly, more the number of buckets, better the parallelism achieved during join in general
   * assuming there is no resource constraint.
   *
   * If hybridScanEnabled is true, rank algorithm follows the algorithm above, but we prioritize
   * the index with larger common source data, so that we could minimize the amount of data
   * for on-the-fly shuffle or merge.
   *
   * @param spark SparkSession.
   * @param leftChild Logical relation of left child of the join.
   * @param rightChild Logical relation of right child of the join.
   * @param indexPairs Index pairs for left and right side of the join. All index pairs are
   *                   compatible with each other.
   * @return Rearranged index pairs according to their ranking. The first is the best.
